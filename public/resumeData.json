    "bio": "Hi there! I am Sandy aka Sandman! I am a full stack developer with two decades of production experience. I have been involved with compaines such as BKFS, Auction.com, Marriott International and amazon lab126. The art of software development is the ability to quickly and accurately decipher and leverage technologies that rapidly transform business requirements into functional software. Simplicity is the key to extensibility and complexity is it’s antithesis. When a system is well designed, maintaining and extending its codebase becomes less problematic.    This counters the human tendency to over engineer programs with scope creep. Defining well organized object models, solving cross cutting concerns, and clearly defining service layers make system development a breeze and enable the continuous delivery of code. In my experience, the best engineers understand work/life harmony. Personally, I find balance by spending time outdoors, playing musical instruments, and keeping my tropical landscape lush. I have a wife, 2 daughters, a black lab, and a cat.",

Although Sandy reported to me briefly while he was at Marriott, I could see and sense his desire to be as productive as possible during this time. Sandy has a great personality which adds to his ability on interacting well with other team members, either as a coach or a team mate. I would recommend Sandy highly due to this combination of skills and great personality traits.",

He jumped into our team with little background in Salesforce but he asserted himself without fail as the leader of our Heroku development team. He brings with him a full stack background that can be applied in almost any development environment. He truly enjoys sharing his knowledge and will go out of his way to make sure people have what they need to be successful.",

The thing that stands out most to me about Sandy is his persistence and dedication to solving problems: whether it's organizational issues or tough technological problems, Sandy will be the first to step up with possible solutions. Sandy is adept at spotting inefficiencies in process and communication gaps and he actively works to improve these. In addition to being a great technical resource on the team, Sandy also stands out when it comes to his knowledge of the business and domain he is operating within. He would routinely help me prototype new interfaces and systems to help add value to the business, and by doing so, we were able to accomplish an incredible amount on the Auction.com platform. I am eager to find opportunities to work with Sandy again.",
